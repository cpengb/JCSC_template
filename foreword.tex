Hello, world! Here is the first journal issue I put together for CCSC. It has been
a pleasure working with John Meinke to learn about CCSC publication process.
John has worked tirelessly for decades as the journal editor and I will do my
best to continue the legacy he had of dedicated service to the community.

I am implementing two major changes in the publication process. First, the
journals will be typeset in \LaTeX (as this current issue). \LaTeX\ allows authors
to typeset their final ``camera-ready" copies, which are, then, compiled into
a journal. Therefore,
I would prefer that authors submit their final manuscripts in \LaTeX. Word docs
are acceptable if an author doesn't want to learn/use \LaTeX, in which case a
regional editor or I will need to convert the documents into \LaTeX. Here is a
repository that contains instructions, templates, and links to learning
resources: \url{https://github.com/lubaochuan/ccsc-editor} The second change
is to use on-demand printing. You can still get a hard-copy of the journal
through your regional conference or by ordering a copy yourself on Amazon.
This approach reduces paper waste and allows me to fix errors in a journal
after it is published.

I am very excited about my work, but I cannot produce quality journals without
authors contributing to the content. Please continue writing papers to share your
ideas and experiences. The CCSC community depends
on you to stay active and relevant helping all of us perfect our craft.
