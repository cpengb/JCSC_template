On behalf of the 2018 CCSC Eastern Conference Committee, welcome to the 2018
CCSC Eastern Conference and the new Ballston Center at Marymount University.
We hope that everyone gets a chance to explore the greater DC area and see
everything Arlington has to offer. We are looking forward to a great conference
this year and are excited about sessions available this for students and
faculty. Whether new or returning to CCSC, we think youâ€™ll find new and
exciting sessions for your field of interest.
